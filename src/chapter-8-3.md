Continuous improvement involves ongoing evaluation and refinement of cross-cultural conflict management practices. This technique involves using feedback, performance metrics, and case studies to identify areas for improvement and implementing changes to improve the effectiveness of conflict management strategies.

Conclusion
----------

Effective cross-cultural conflict management requires ongoing evaluation and continuous improvement. Surveys, feedback forms, performance metrics, and case studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of conflict management strategies and identify areas for improvement.
